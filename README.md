# LIRI Bot Assignment
LIRI Bot serves as a language interpreter, utilizing the CLI as a means to query different APIs, each linked to a specific command phrase. LIRI could also be called the node starter bot, as it serves as a good starting point for npm utilization, specifically: fs, request, dotEnv, and moment. The three APIs used include:

- Bands In Town
- OMDB API
- node-spotify-api

The first two required the use of request, while an existing package was used for spotify. A screen grab on each CLI command is included below:
